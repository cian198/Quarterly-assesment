    <h1> Welcome to my life!</h1>
    <p>Hi there! How are you? Can you be my friend? By the way, before anything else,I would like to introduce myself to you.<br>
    <p>I am Marlvon Parel, 13 years old and from Camp 7, Baguio City. I have a sister named Maelee Elize. My mother is a teacher, while my father is a construction worker. I also have a pet named Tomas.<br>
    <p>Currently, I am studying at UBSHS. My hobbies are playing basketball, badminton, beatboxing, and dancing. The greatest dream I have is to become a successful chef. It is my joy and pleasure to serve people good food.<br>
    <p> We always travel to our province, Ilocos Sur, to celebrate the Christmas season with my cousin. My favorite foods are sushi and carbonara and i &lt;3 them. We play online games like COD together. These are a few parts of my life that I can share with you.<br>
